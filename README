This simple script just passes out a specified linux installer 
environment to whatever host that does PXE on the network. No more, no 
less. Additional features can be added given interest and desperate 
pleading, but I'll release the simple case for now.

Usage Example: You want to install linux on a machine that has no cdrom 
(like those new-fangled netbooks). Just hook it up to a network that's 
running easypxe, start the computer, and you're golden. 

Prerequisites:
	Net::DHCP::Constants
	Net::DHCP::Packet
	Net::TFTPd

Instructions: 

1. Copy your network boot kernel and initrd into the tftp_root directory 
   provided in this package.

2. Edit tftp_root/pxelinux.cfg/default file, specifying the filenames of 
   the kernel and initrd, as well as any special options. It should look
   something like this:

##Begin File#####################################

default linux
label linux
        kernel vmlinuz
        append initrd=initrd.img foooption=bar..

##End File#######################################

Some mainstream distributions (RedHat, Debian) may already have a 
provided config file hosted somewhere. If so, I recommend using it 
instead.

3. Edit the configuration section of the easypxe script, specifying the
   IP of the interface that will be providing PXE and the IP you want 
   to assign to the client.

3. ./easypxe (as root)

4. Enjoy (Considering you didn't have to install tftpd, dhcpd, and xinetd, 
and google around for a howto)

**A suggestion- If you are doing this from computer to computer via a 
single cable, some DVD distributions (like RedHat) can be mounted
in a http docroot on the machine running easypxe and you can do the 
entire install process between the two machines without needing to run
as a firewall to forward installer traffic. You get a speedy install,
too. 

All questions, inquiries should be forwarded to amin@aminastaneh.net, 
unless you are going to complain how this script is not RFC-compliant. 
In that case, /dev/null is the appropriate place to send your message.
