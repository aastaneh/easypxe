EASYPXE- A simple PXE daemon (dhcpd and tftpd), all written in Perl.

This particular script just passes out a single specified linux enviroment 
to whatever host does PXE on the network. No more, no less. Additional features
can be added given interest and desperate pleading, but I'll release the simple
solution for now. 

Prerequisites:
	Net::DHCP::Constants
	Net::DHCP::Packet
	Net::TFTPD

Instructions: 

1. Copy your network boot kernel and initrd into the tftp_root directory provided in this package.
2. Edit tftp_root/pxelinux.cfg/default file, specifying the filenames of the kernel and initrd. It should look something like this:

##Begin File############################

default linux
label linux
        kernel vmlinuz
        append initrd.img noapic

##End File##############################

Some mainstream distributions (RedHat, Debian) may already have an example config file hosted somewhere. If so, I recommend using it instead.

3. ./easypxe (as root)
4. Enjoy (Considering you didn't have to install tftpd, dhcpd, and xinetd, and google around for a howto)

All questions, inquiries should be forwarded to amin@aminastaneh.net, unless you are going to complain how this script is not RFC-compliant, which in that case /dev/null is the appropriate place to send your message.
